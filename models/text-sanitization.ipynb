      "Thread operation normal like write operations. You have more read operations so you can segregate on when you segregate the logic. For command query you will also segregate the databases for it.\n",
      "So yeah, that is basically a secure segregation and.\n",
      "Socket breaker, I already explained.\n",
      "Then we have API gateway.\n",
      "So API gateway means that you have a single point of entry for all your services, and the single point of entry which acts as an API gateway can handle your.\n",
      "Basically, it can simplify a request. It can handle authentication and authorization, and it can also handle the load balancing.\n",
      "So that is API gateway and.\n",
      "Then we have database per service which states that in microservices design.\n",
      "For every every microservice, every service should be having its own dedicated database.\n",
      "Not. Not No2 services should.\n",
      "It should be sharing in any database.\n",

       "      <td>Yeah, one is cqrs pattern. And then we have one is a circuit breaker pattern which I already explained you. And. So first let me describe the cqrs pattern. So cqrs means command and query responsibility segregation. So what happens in in microservices you have lot of logic so you want to separate out your command. Queries from the from your normal command to from your normal queries. So let's say the database has. Your system will be having more queries as compared to like. Thread operation normal like write operations. You have more read operations so you can segregate on when you segregate the logic. For command query you will also segregate the databases for it. So yeah, that is basically a secure segregation and. Socket breaker, I already explained. Then we have API gateway. So API gateway means that you have a single point of entry for all your services, and the single point of entry which acts as an API gateway can handle your. Basically, it can simplify a request. It can handle authentication and authorization, and it can also handle the load balancing. So that is API gateway and. Then we have database per service which states that in microservices design. For every every microservice, every service should be having its own dedicated database. Not. Not No2 services should. It should be sharing in any database. Yeah. So. Let's.</td>\n",

So The thing is state of circuit breaker changes from close to open when failure rate is above a certain threshold which you can configure in your system. So let's say you have 100 request out of A10 fail. So you can configure the percentage there that above 10 if there is any failure the circuit will open. After that, once the threshold is reached, then all the other request from the client side will be rejected in the back end system and no further calls will be permitted and after a certain time duration has elapsed which also you can configure the circuit breaker state changes from. Open to half open and it allows. A certain number of calls to see to basically check whether the system is now available or not. If it is available, the state will change to open, otherwise it will be. It will still be closed.  \n",

You are basically hitting the APIs of another service and that service is basically down, not down. Actually it is not that responsive for the time. So instead of giving the response within one second, it is taking three or four seconds. But in your service, which is the caller service, you have configured the. Timeout to be two second, let's say. Now you have hit one request to service S2. It has not responded within time. It took three seconds, but you have. You will get the timeout error in your API, so you will try retry again because you have configured retry also so you will retry and now there is a second call from your your service to service S2. So, but the service S2 has send the response for the call one. To service S1, but like after a delay of one second. So based on this like you will be getting more APIs, you will be retrying more which will make which will which will result in more traffic in service 2. So the service to which was already like slow in response now because it has more traffic on its side, it will be more slow. So which can result in the downtime of that service or it can crash? So that is what Thunder problem is basically.  \n",

So any design pattern you have worked in microservice?  \n",
       "7  Yeah, one is cqrs pattern. And then we have one is a circuit breaker pattern which I already explained you. And. So first let me describe the cqrs pattern. So cqrs means command and query responsibility segregation. So what happens in in microservices you have lot of logic so you want to separate out your command. Queries from the from your normal command to from your normal queries. So let's say the database has. Your system will be having more queries as compared to like. Thread operation normal like write operations. You have more read operations so you can segregate on when you segregate the logic. For command query you will also segregate the databases for it. So yeah, that is basically a secure segregation and. Socket breaker, I already explained. Then we have API gateway. So API gateway means that you have a single point of entry for all your services, and the single point of entry which acts as an API gateway can handle your. Basically, it can simplify a request. It can handle authentication and authorization, and it can also handle the load balancing. So that is API gateway and. Then we have database per service which states that in microservices design. For every every microservice, every service should be having its own dedicated database. Not. Not No2 services should. It should be sharing in any database. Yeah. So. Let's.  \n",
